                       <p>I am a computer science professional with expertise in full-stack web development. Combining a creative mindset with in-depth analysis and technical comprehension, I work to ensure final products meet strict quality standards and requirements. Likewise, I am capable of enhancing existing services and applications, troubleshooting complicated technical issues, and constantly devising new, effective solutions. My co-workers and supervisors have commended me for my relentless work ethic, dedication to teamwork, and ability to succeed under immense pressure.</p>

                       <p>I thrive on challenges and take on new projects with confidence. Recently, I executed a remodel of a client’s website using my expertise with WordPress, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I’m well versed in the standard tools and technologies associated with full-stack web development, and I’m always seeking to further expand my proficiencies through new projects and learning opportunities. As I continue growing as a professional, I’m excited to build connections with like-minded individuals who share my interests. Let’s connect.</p>
